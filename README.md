# **AtlantaX**

![AtlantaX Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300.png?text=Welcome+to+AtlantaX) <!-- Replace with your custom banner image -->

**AtlantaX** is an exciting open-source mini-game inspired by tap-to-earn sensations like *Hamster Kombat* and *Notcoin*. Players tap to earn virtual currency, unlock upgrades, participate in events, and connect with others through squads and leaderboards. Built with modern JavaScript tools like Node.js and Bun, AtlantaX is lightweight, scalable, and perfect for both casual players and developers looking to contribute or customize.

This README provides everything you need to get started, from installation to deployment, along with opportunities to collaborate or request custom mini-game development.

---

## **Installation**

Follow these detailed steps to set up AtlantaX on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)).
- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher recommended ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)). (This will include npm).
- **MongoDB**: A running MongoDB instance (local or cloud-hosted like MongoDB Atlas). ([Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)).
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- A code editor like VS Code (optional but recommended).

### **Setup Instructions**

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AtlantaX.git # Replace yourusername if you forked
    cd AtlantaX
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables (Backend)**:
    -   Navigate to the project root (`AtlantaX`).
    -   Create a `.env` file by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        (You might need to create `.env.example` first if it doesn't exist, with `PORT` and `MONGODB_URI`)
    -   Edit the `.env` file with your settings:
        ```env
        PORT=3000
        MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/atlantax
        # Ensure your MongoDB server is running and accessible at this URI.
        # For MongoDB Atlas, use your Atlas connection string.
        ```
        *Note: `SESSION_SECRET` is not currently used.*

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies**:
    -   In the project root directory (`AtlantaX`):
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm install
        cd ..
        ```
        (Return to the root directory)

---

## **Running the Application (Development)**

You'll need two terminals open to run both the backend and frontend development servers.

1.  **Start the Backend Server**:
    -   In your first terminal, from the project root (`AtlantaX`):
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    -   This will typically start the Node.js/Express server on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server**:
    -   In your second terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm run dev
        ```
    -   This will start the Vite development server, usually on `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Access the Application**:
    -   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`.
    -   The frontend (running on Vite) will proxy API requests to the backend server.

---

## **Building for Production**

1.  **Build the Frontend**:
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm run build
        cd ..
        ```
        (Return to the root directory)
    -   This will create optimized static assets in the `frontend/dist` directory. The backend Express server is already configured to serve files from this location.

2.  **Backend**:
    -   The Node.js backend (`src/backend/server.js`) does not require a separate build step. It runs directly using Node.

---

## **Deployment**

Deploying a full-stack application like AtlantaX involves deploying both the Node.js backend and the React frontend assets.

**General Steps for a Platform (e.g., Render, Heroku, VPS):**

1.  **Platform Setup**:
    -   Choose a hosting platform that supports Node.js applications.
    -   Configure your platform to install dependencies using `npm install` for the root `package.json` (for backend) and then `cd frontend && npm install` for the frontend.

2.  **Build Command**:
    -   Set your platform's build command to build the React frontend. This typically involves:
        ```bash
        cd frontend && npm run build
        ```

3.  **Start Command**:
    -   Set your platform's start command to run the Node.js backend server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
        (This relies on the `start` script in the root `package.json`, which should be `node src/backend/server.js`).

4.  **Environment Variables**:
    -   Set the `MONGODB_URI` (and `PORT` if necessary) environment variables on your hosting platform, similar to your local `.env` file.
    -   Ensure `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` on the hosting platform for optimizations.

5.  **Serving Frontend**:
    -   The Express backend is already configured to serve static files from `frontend/dist`. Ensure your hosting service correctly routes all non-API traffic to the Node.js server so it can serve the React app's `index.html`.

**Example (Conceptual for Render):**
-   **Build Command**: `npm install && cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
-   **Start Command**: `node src/backend/server.js` (or `npm start` if defined in root `package.json`)

---

## **Usage**

- **Playing**: Access the game via the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` in development). Tap the screen to earn coins, buy upgrades, join squads, and view leaderboards.
- **Backend Development**: Modify source code in `src/backend/`. The server (`npm run dev` in root) will typically auto-restart due to `nodemon`.
- **Frontend Development**: Modify source code in `frontend/src/`. The Vite dev server (`npm run dev` in `frontend/`) provides Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast updates.
- **Testing**: (Placeholder for future test instructions)
  ```bash
  # Example: npm test (if tests are added to root package.json)
  # cd frontend && npm test (if tests are added to frontend package.json)
  ```
