**AtlantaX** is an exciting open-source mini-game inspired by tap-to-earn sensations like *Hamster Kombat* and *Notcoin*. Players tap to earn virtual currency, unlock upgrades, participate in events, and connect with others through squads and leaderboards. Built with modern JavaScript tools like Node.js and Bun, AtlantaX is lightweight, scalable, and perfect for both casual players and developers looking to contribute or customize.

This README provides everything you need to get started, from installation to deployment, along with opportunities to collaborate or request custom mini-game development.

## **Installation**

Follow these detailed steps to set up AtlantaX on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Git**: For cloning the repository ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/))
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A code editor like VS Code (optional but recommended)

### **Installing Node.js**

Node.js is required to run the backend and manage dependencies.

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version (v16 or higher recommended).
   - For Windows/Mac: Run the installer and follow the prompts.
   - For Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nodejs npm
     ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   You should see version numbers (e.g., `v18.17.0` for Node.js).

### **Installing Bun**

Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime and toolkit that speeds up development and builds.

1. **Install Bun**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
     ```
   - On Windows (via WSL or Git Bash):
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
     ```
   - Alternatively, use npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g bun
     ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   bun --version
   ```
   Expect a version like `1.0.0` or higher.

### **Cloning and Setting Up the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AtlantaX.git
   cd AtlantaX
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username after creating the repo.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - With **Bun** (faster):
     ```bash
     bun install
     ```
   - With **npm** (traditional):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```bash
     touch .env
     ```
   - Add these variables (customize as needed):
     ```env
     PORT=3000
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/atlantax
     SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Using **Bun**:
     ```bash
     bun run dev
     ```
   - Using **npm**:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see AtlantaX in action!

    3. Configure your domain (optional).

- **Full Deployment (Frontend + Backend)**:
  - Platforms: Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean
  - Steps:
    1. Deploy the backend:
       ```bash
       git push heroku main
       ```
    2. Set environment variables on the platform‚Äôs dashboard.
    3. Link the frontend to the backend‚Äôs API URL (e.g., `https://yourapp.herokuapp.com`).
